Juso Coworking holds the distinction of being Japan's third coworking space and Osaka's first, established in December 2010. Run by a husband-and-wife team in the Juso district, this family-oriented workspace embodies the warmth of traditional Japanese community values. Located just 3 minutes from Juso Station, it offers flexible options from daily drop-ins to monthly memberships and private booths. Beyond IT work, the space welcomes various cultural activities and hobby groups, creating a diverse community atmosphere. With its pioneering status in Japan's coworking movement and its commitment to preventing freelancer isolation, Juso Coworking remains a beloved venue for tech meetups and community gatherings.
