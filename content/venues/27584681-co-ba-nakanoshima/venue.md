Co-ba Nakanoshima is a charming coworking space housed in the historic Riverside Building, a National Registered Tangible Cultural Property on the banks of the Dojima River. Just 5 minutes from Higobashi Station, this former Showa-era social salon has been transformed into a modern workspace that maintains its vintage character. With floor-to-ceiling windows offering serene river views, the 36-seat open space provides a calm atmosphere for focused work and meaningful connections. Founded by certified public accountant Hiroaki Hashide, the space embodies the philosophy that human connections create infinite possibilities, making it an ideal venue for tech meetups and professional networking events.
