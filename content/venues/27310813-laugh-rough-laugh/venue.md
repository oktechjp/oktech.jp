Laugh Rough Laugh is a unique parent-child café (Oyako Café) near Shitennoji Mae Yuhigaoka Station in Osaka. While primarily designed as a family-friendly space where parents can relax while childcare professionals supervise children in a basement play area, the venue's multi-floor layout and café atmosphere have made it suitable for small tech meetups and workshops. The quiet second floor provides a peaceful environment for discussions and presentations, while the professional childcare services allow parent developers to participate in events without worrying about childcare. This innovative concept space bridges the gap between family life and professional networking in Osaka's tech community.
