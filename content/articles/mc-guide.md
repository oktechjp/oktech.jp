**üëã Hello Friend!**

So, you are finding yourself in the situation to need to MC the next event?
Wonderful! We are all stoked that you put up with this challenge!

## Your Event

As MC you can make the event your own! **You should feel comfortable!** You feeling well is helping to make everyone feel comfortable. Here are some thoughts about that:

- [ ] Dress in a way that makes you feel good. _(Maybe with an OKTech T-Shirt?, ...)_
- [ ] Have some self care before the event. _(Good coffee, workout,...)_
- [ ] Clean what needs cleaning. _(Clothes, bag, computer, hair...)_
- [ ] Bring snacks/drinks. _(Talk to the group about reimbursements)_
- [ ] Bring accessories/helpers for your comfort. _(Martin brings his hat to fiddle with, but it could be a dog - check with the venue, a ball, a laser pointer,...)_
- [ ] Bring business cards. It is silly but some people might ask you for a card and if you don't have one it might feel uncomfortable. Like you are not part of the group.

## Other People

It is good to have an eye out on who comes to the event. Have a peek at the guest list and look if you know someone. Are other volunteers coming too? Often we have presentations at the event, then it helps to be able to know the presenters.

- [ ] Do you know how many people signed up for?
- [ ] Do you know how the presenters want to be called? _(By their nickname? Full name? Do they have a professional title?, ...)_
- [ ] Do you know what to highlight about the presenters? _(Are they a long time member? Are they a first time presenter? Have they presented at other venues?,...)_
- [ ] Do you know what the presenter wants out of the meetup? _(Some just want to share, others want to interact with the audience, ...)_
- [ ] Do you have a way to contact the presenters? _(Are you Discord friends, do you have some messenger or Line contact, telephone number?,...)_

With this information, it is easier for you to get in the weeds.

## On the day

At the Meetup it is nice if you could remember the following checklist as it helps to give attendees some structure.

- [ ] Explain OKTech in your words
- [ ] Point out that OKTech is a volunteer effort
- [ ] Explain why you volunteer
- [ ] Explain the layout of the venue _(where are the toilets?)_
- [ ] Introduce Speakers
- [ ] Highlight Discord as an online meeting addon
- [ ] Talk about drinks after the event
- [ ] Mention about the next event
- [ ] Introduce the venue and say thanks
- [ ] Talk about what you are looking forward to at today's event
- [ ] Talk about the event in the context of all events happening in this year

This is not a strict checklist, if you forget something: that is fine, the list is there for you improve.

## Important to keep in mind

As MC **you are the main person responsible for the event**. If something happens, you are the one to tell people what to do. In emergencies or other unexpected situations its up to you to make everyone stay calm. If you feel stressed about this: communicate with other volunteers at the event. They can help you figure this out. In preparation, maybe give following things a thought:

- [ ] Read the [Code of Conduct](https://oktech.jp/code-of-conduct)
- [ ] What do you do if a presenter is late or has to cancel? _(It happens rarely but sometimes does)_
- [ ] Are you mentally prepared for an Earthquake? _(Recommendation: visit the [Abeno Disaster Prevention Center](https://en.osaka-info.jp/spot/osaka-abeno-life-safety-learning-center/))_
- [ ] Do you know what to do if someone needs to go to a hospital?

## OK

All this is to help you feel good about your task. We wouldn't have asked you if we didn't think you can handle the job.

üëç Good Luck! You can do it!
