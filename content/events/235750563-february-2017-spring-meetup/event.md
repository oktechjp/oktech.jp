Dear all,

As the new year unfolds, we welcome you back to another exciting meetup on topics related to web design and development! We hope to see you on February 18 at 6PM for another exchange of ideas and knowledge, at our usual venue kindly provided by Aiming Inc.

This month Michael Rambeau will give us a talk on "Javascript and web development in 2017". No doubt that we will have a lively session on what to expect in web development this year. Barbara Marcantonio will talk to us about Gestalt design applied to web design and other practical design tips to enhance UI and UX that can be useful for both designers and non-designers.

As of now we still have openings for presentations. If you would like (us) to talk about something of your interest or if you have something you would like to present please mention it in the comments. We’d love to hear from you.

After the meetup we will go out for drinks and socializing at a nearby Izakaya.
