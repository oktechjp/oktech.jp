Dear Developers and Designers, May the Web be with you.

We hope that you enjoyed your holidays and had a lovely golden week. With a little delay, we are happy to announce the next Designers and Developers meetup taking place on May 26th.

We were unfortunately unable to arrange the event at our usual place, kindly provided to us by Aiming, but we were able to secure a room at Synergy Marketing (https://www.synergy-marketing.co.jp/company/en/location/).

This month, Eduard Urbach will give us a talk on 'Aero - Web libraries for Go' (https://github.com/aerogo/aero). Go is gaining relevance as a programming language in the world of web development. Let's see how Eduard has used this amazing language to build a web server.

As for the second talk, Alvaro Parra will talk about how to build web applications through stories. Writing stories as examples of how the user will interact with the application, it is easier to define the business model, and the communication between the team improves.

As usual, there will be a chance to network with each other, and we will head out for drinks afterward.
