Hello Friends,

this month we are happy for Helpfeel to host us and we are looking forward for you to join us near the Kyoto palace.

For this Saturday, [Sacha](https://sachagreif.com/) will be sharing the result of ["State of HTML 2023"](https://stateofhtml.com/en-US). He will go into the findings of last years survey, what we can take trend indicators for future work. Also we will get an insight into how the Survey was conducted and what techniques he developed.
