Escape the Sun and touch Go!

After his introduction to Docker we decided that we need a bit more time for his topics and this June we are dedicating an afternoon to Go.

Kinbiko will introduce us to all major parts of the Go programming language. From building to testing. How to best work on a Go project. It is going to be less about the language *\- you should be somewhat familiar with general programming\.* Bring your computer and let's try to see together what we can get done.

The workshop will be split into two parts. You may wish to attend just one or both, depending on your familiarity with Go.

13:00\~15:00 - The first part will cover go specific issues. If you are familiar with programming, this should help you find your way around and get you to a place where you produce code. Good for people with prior coding experience. If you are familiar with go you may be asked to help out others.
15:00\~15:30 - Break.
15:30\~17:30 - The second part is more for experienced gophers or programmers, where we'll discuss best practices, show tips on how to refactor code. It is a lot more opinionated. If you just learned Go on the day it might be a bit challenging to follow along, but here too everyone is welcome (you'll probably learn how idiomatic Go is different from your favorite language)

The schedule is a rough outline, depending on progress it may shift during the day.
