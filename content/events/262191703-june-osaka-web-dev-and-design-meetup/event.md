The rainy season is upon us, as the rain grants us brief reprieve from the heat of summer. However, this is not the only gift we are given this month, as we forecast a shower of great web talks, too!

This month Yann Klein will talk to us about Web Augmented Reality, at a time when AR is heating up in the app space.

Mathieu Mayer will talk to us about UI Design patterns for developers. He will share UI Design tricks that developers can use to make their apps look good on their own. (Note [28 June 2019]: Unfortunately we've just heard from Mathieu that he is not feeling well and he will not be able to present his talk tomorrow.)

We'll be meeting at the same location as before, kindly provided by IDCF. After the talks there will be an opportunity to chat and get to know each other over drinks and food at a nearby izakaya.
