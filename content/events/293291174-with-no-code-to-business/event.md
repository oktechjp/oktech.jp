Hello everyone! 👋

Calling all tech enthusiasts! 🔥

Join us in Kyoto ⛩️ for an exciting night of networking and discussion.
We're thrilled to feature a panel of no-code early adopters who will share their stories and insights on the current no-code scene and how they integrated it into their operations.

Get ready to connect with international techies, ask questions, and share your own experiences. 🤩

Our first presenter, [Hiroko Yokota](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hiroko-yokota-28706515a/), will speak about her experience with business development for [BtoB Hotel App WASIMIL](https://www.wasimil.com/), and how she leveraged no-code solutions for startup business development.
We'll get a behind-the-scenes look at a Kyoto-based startup using no-code to accelerate their business.

We're still looking for a second presenter! [Join our Discord channel](https://owddm.com/discord) and pitch your ideas! 🎤

We welcome all knowledge-sharing in our community, so don't hesitate to join us! 🤝
