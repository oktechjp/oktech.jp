Hello everyone!

The Japanese New Year has started and we are kicking this April off with two presentations at R3 Institute. ðŸš€

Greg King will be talking about text editors. Most people these days use VSCode but he will discuss using Vim in the upcoming event, ***"To Vim or not to Vim. That's a question?"***

Vim is a terminal only text editor that can be challenging to use on the first try. With Greg's help we will figure out why it is still relevant and why we may want to learn it. Be prepared you might not be able to exit. *(More in the [discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/1034792577293094972/1110872279845457920))*

In our second talk, Akina and Martin will be tackling the topic of ***"Signal to Noise ratio"***. In this prescient topic, they will be looking practical impacts of content generation (AI). Martin will be introducing theoretical framework and show how terms and solutions of classic signal processing could maybe proof useful when talking about the current challenges with AI. Akina will then look at the practical Marketing with AI in mind. How will the tools change? What new things do we need to consider? (More in the [discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/1034792577293094972/1210071322193821796))
