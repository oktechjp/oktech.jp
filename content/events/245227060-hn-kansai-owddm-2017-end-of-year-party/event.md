This year is ending, and as always this means we're having our end-of-year party. Be prepared to spend an evening talking with people about tech, business & design and other topics in english over pizza in Umeda!

We picked a fixed 2400yen food menu and 500yen per drink. You choose how much you drink ^_^.

About the Location:
The galleria pizzeria is located about 10~15mins walk from Umeda towards Shin-Fukushima. We chose it because of the great food and the open atmosphere.
