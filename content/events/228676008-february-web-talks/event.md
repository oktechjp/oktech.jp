Hello Web Enthusiasts,

After last months experiment we are returning back to our regular schedule in this short month. We welcome web developers and designers from Osaka or other corners of Kansai: Please join us at the meeting space of Aiming (that they generously provided) for an relaxed exchange.

We usually have a wide range of topics. Be it databases, facebook logins, design workflows, internationalisation, code structures or github; the topics is wide and varied. All you need to bring is an open mind and an interest in the web.

As of now we have still an opening for presentations if you would like (us) to talk about something of your interest please mention it in the comments. If you have something you would like to present, please contact Martin - who will be once more this months host.

Note: After the meetup we usually go out for drinks and socializing to a nearby izakaya.
