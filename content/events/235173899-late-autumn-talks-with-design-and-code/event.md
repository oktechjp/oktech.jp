Dear Web enthusiasts and developers,

Welcome back for our November Meetup, probably our last regular meetup scheduled for this year. This month we couldn’t arrange the event at our usual place kindly provided to us by Aiming, but we were able to secure a room at Synergy Marketing (https://www.synergy-marketing.co.jp/company/en/location/). It’s a bit harder to access but it’s one of the few places that can accommodate us all.

Anyway, changing our venue is worth the hassle because one of our speakers this month is Koji Kimura-san from Button Inc (http://btn-inc.jp/about/). He will be talking about Designing off-screen interaction.

Updated: Another reason why you should attend this meetup is our second speaker, Jeremiah Chienda, who will be talking about Functional programming. He will help demystify the newcomers who don't know what to make of it and will spark a good discussion with the veterans of this programming paradigm that is becoming mainstream.

Did we manage to capture your interest? We hope to see you on November 26 at Synergy Marketing. Please note that we will start at 7PM this time, one hour later than usual. Here is how to get there (https://www.google.com/maps/dir/34.7036282,135.4977071/Japan,+%E3%80%92530-0003+%C5%8Csaka-fu,+%C5%8Csaka-shi,+Kita-ku,+D%C5%8Djima,+1+Chome%E2%88%926%E2%88%9220,+%E5%A0%82%E5%B3%B6%E3%82%A2%E3%83%90%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B6/@34.7000861,135.4928541,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m9!4m8!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x6000e6f2706da48f:0xb88c3a6d57083f1c!2m2!1d135.4963967!2d34.6969038!3e2?hl=en) from Umeda train station. I am told that the meeting space is inside a building that is really hard to miss; you know you have arrived at the right place if you can see a book shop at the 1st floor. Inside the building there is only one central elevator that will take you up to the 21st floor (you will find us there).

As usual, after the meetup we will go out to a near-by Izakaya for drinks and post-meetup socializing. If you know any good places to eat/ drink around that area please let us know and we will make a reservation. It might spare the effort of going back to Umeda, at our regular drinking spot.

See you soon,
