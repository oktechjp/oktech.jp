Hi Friends, ðŸ‘‹

we are still putting together the whole plan for the June meetup, but we are happy to announce that [Helpfeel](https://helpfeel.com/en-us/) *(prev. Nota)* will be hosting us and we will be looking to find snacks right there.

*(Update: Jake has initially been scheduled to present on React and the DOM but he has been covered with work this week and will need to hold it at another time.)*

In our presentation of the day, Martin will take a look at "**TypeScript Tips and Tricks for React"**. In it he will attempt to share how he uses TypeScript with React and how he notices that it can be difficult to use TypeScript. Maybe you can catch some new and old reasons on what power to get from using TypeScript.

After that we will be having two discussions. The first will be by **Parama** who will be hosting a round table on the topic of **Relational Databases or Not** in which she would like to figure out with us what we think is better and why.

And... we have a second discussion this Saturday! Sacha will be reflecting a little bit about things **he learned in the past**. Things that are outdated by now, and that he will probably not use again. In a conversation he would like to explore how knowledge becomes less important over time and what we can treat as experience.

This is going to be a full evening and we hope to see you there! If you can't make it this time, [join the Discord](https://owddm.com/discord) to figure out when the next one is and maybe share if you feel like presenting something yourself.

*Photos: Volunteers are usually taking photos at the events for ourselves and to be presented at our homepage. If you find a photo of yourself on our homepage that you have a problem with, please let us know through GitHub or at the event itself, thanks.*
