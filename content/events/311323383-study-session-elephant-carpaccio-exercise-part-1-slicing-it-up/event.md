Are you a software engineer who enjoys digging into new ideas, practices, and patterns that strengthen your craft? Join us for the next **Study Session**, a gathering for engineers who don’t just code, but want to understand the *why* and *how* behind solid software design.

In this session, we’ll dive into the **principle of slicing up solutions**: how to cut “elephants” (big pieces of work) into ultra-thin slices that are still functional, demo-able, and valuable. Through group exercises and discussion, you’ll practice writing tiny use cases and challenge yourself to slice thinner than you thought possible.

**What you’ll do:**

* Explore what makes a story a real slice (vertical, testable, user-value).
* Practice writing 10–20 use cases for a simple product.
* Reflect on how slicing affects teamwork and delivery.

**Session difficulty:** Junior Engineer or Product Related (familiarity with basic SDLC is helpful).

**Meeting Content:**

* Introduction
* Explain the subject
* Story writing exercise
* Discussion
* Feedback & Wrap-up

**Discussion Style:**

* Raise your hand when you’d like to speak
* Keep each contribution to a maximum of 2 minutes
