Hello aspiring developers, professional developers and hobbyist developers!

It’s June and that means it’s finally time for another meetup!

For the first half of the June meetup we would like to do either a talk on workflow using Git, a technology used very often in web development for variation control and a powerful tool for collaborative projects and open source software, or on Continuous Integration, a software engineering practice of merging all of the code written by developers working on a project into a shared repository several times a day. I’ve set up a survey, so please take a second to fill it out and tell us which one you would prefer to hear about: https://www.wedgies.com/question/57597dc200f88e18002b18ac

For the second half we are hoping to do a presentation on commonly used design tools or design concepts. If you have a favorite design tool that you use frequently and you are willing to share with the group we would really appreciate it! You can either message me (Jake Biros) or any of the other event organizers if you would like to volunteer.

Any of these topics would be useful for developers of any level, so feel free to stop by no matter how experienced you are!

To wrap it all up, as always we will be going out for food and drinks at a local izakaya afterwards so if you have time after the event come out and socialize with your fellow web development enthusiasts :)
