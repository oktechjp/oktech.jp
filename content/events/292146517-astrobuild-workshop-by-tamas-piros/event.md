Hello Everyone! 👋

We have a bit of a special event this month. [Tamas Piros](https://tpiros.dev/) is on travel here and he offered to have a full 2h workshop with us! 😲 Different location and a different time than our usual meetup but it should be totally worth it! 👍

Join us with your computer 💻 for a workshop, where Tamas will introduce us to [Astro.build](https://astro.build). The recent state-of-the-art front-end framework to build websites fast. It has taken many hearts and if you haven't had the chance to touch it yet, it may be a good opportunity for you to level up! 🚀
