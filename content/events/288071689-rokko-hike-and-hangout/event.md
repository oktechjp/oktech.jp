Please bring your own packed lunch for the hike. Light snacks and drinks will be provided at the rooftop.

**Itinerary:**
We'll start our hike by meeting at [Rokko Ropeway Ground station](https://goo.gl/maps/arHY2fYAmFY26hX17) at 8:00 AM. From there, we'll take the ropeway (600 JPY) up to the top of mount Rokko and hike along the mountain range, taking a few breaks at interesting spots along the way (Tenjioji Temple, public art park). At 11, we'll eat our lunch (please bring your own packed lunch) and begin our descent from the top of mount Maya. You can either hike down or take the Mt. Maya cable car. We'll then hang out at a rooftop patio close by that we are renting from 2:00 PM to 5:45 PM. While hanging out at the rooftop, Martin will host a web design and development-related discussion while attendees cool down with some provided drinks and snacks.
Please bring your own packed lunch and drinks for the hike. After the hike, drinks and light snacks will be provided for attendees at the rooftop.
