Are you thinking about getting into tech? Here is your chance to learn from those who have gone before! OWDDM is kicking off a new series where members of our tech community share their path in tech. Each story is unique, and could inspire you to your own journey.

This month **Chad Kohalyk** introduces us to his 20 year career from being solopreneur to working inside a multinational, to running a remote-first global research startup. He will be joined by a panel to discuss the effects of macro technology trends, why being a generalist can be a *good* thing, and what he looks for when hiring.

The presentation will go for about 20 minutes, followed by discussion and socializing. Come learn from your peers, and share *your* story too!

Furthermore, if you have a topic that you would like to talk about, take the chance and let us know via the [→ Discord](https://owddm.com/discord)

You can also keep in touch with us on our LinkedIn account [→ ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/owddm-kwddm/)[here](https://www.linkedin.com/company/owddm-kwddm/).

Happy New Year!
