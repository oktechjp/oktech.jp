Season's greetings

Hope all of you are safe and healthy.

We would like to organise our End of Year "Virtual" party on Thursday 31st December to celebrate the passing of this dreadful year of 2020. As the world is mostly on lock down, this year we have only managed to organise a few Outdoor meetups. This will be our first online virtual meetup.

Please prepare yourself some good food, champagne, beer, sake or any alcoholic drinks to join us at our first Virtual meetup End of Year party event. We look forward to seeing you and hope that we join us safely from your home. Families are welcome.

Although this is an Osaka event, you can join us wherever you are especially for some of our members who have gone on to do other exciting things around the world. Please note that the time is in JST.

This virtual meetup uses Spaital Chat application. You don't need to install any software, just use a browser and let it access your web cam and microphone. (*note: it seems to work ok with my iPhone but not on my old iPad. )
