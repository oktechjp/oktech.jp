Don't you have enough of the hot summer? Now you can join us to discuss hot topics on web design and development at a new cool place.

Mathieu Mayer will talk to us about UI Design patterns for developers. He will share UI Design tricks that developers can use to make their apps look good on their own.

Meanwhile, James McGrath will be joining us to talk about the latest in front end development.

We'll be meeting at a new location, kindly provided by AmidA. It is near Honmachi station. Special thanks to Aska Uda for arranging that for us. After the talks there will be an opportunity to chat and get to know each other over drinks and food at a nearby izakaya.

This month event will start half an hour earlier at 17:30.

The event is free. We are also accepting donations at the izakaya.

Address: AmidA Osaka Office, 7 Floor, Shinano-bashi Mitsui Building, 1-11, Utsubohonmachi, Nishi-ku, Osaka
