We are back with another OWDDM where Martin has abandoned us (he’s gone to JSCONF in Tokyo, lucky guy) and I, Destiny and friends fill in. We are happy to have you this month again! We are also very excited to see new faces! Welcome!

In this month’s meeting, Sacha joins us to give a preview of the 2023 TokyoDev Developer [Survey results](https://tokyodev-results.onrender.com/en-US/), which polled over 500 international developers working in Japan about their working conditions, as well as discuss the making of the final report.

You can learn more about Tokyo Dev [here](https://tokyodev.com/).

Come with your questions! Come with your passion!! And be sure to come to mingle!

If you want to help organize, speak, or just keep in touch with us join us on our discord here: https://discord.gg/Fd4zcvUP

See you on the 18th!
