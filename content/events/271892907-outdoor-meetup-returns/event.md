Welcome back web developers and designers!

We would like to continuing our outdoor gatherings at Tsurumi Ryokuchi Park on Saturday 26th of September, weather and Covid19 social distancing permitting.

We'd like to keep the floor (lawn?) open this month and hear about projects you're working on, or cool things you've seen that you think will be of interest to other web folk. We know it's tough to go first, so Christian Oliff will kick things off with a quick talk about some new features in Safari 14 that might be of interest, and web developers should consider.

Please bring a picnic mat to sit on and your own food and drinks. Families are welcome. There is also a Lawson close to the station where you can pick up food and drinks on the way.

Meeting point: at the gate of the Tsurumi-ryokuchi Station on the Nagahori Tsurumi-ryokuchi line.

The forecast is pretty uncertain, so we'll update this page if it looks like we'll have to postpone until the following month. We'll also send out a notification via e-mail if things change, so remember to sign up if you're thinking of coming!

If you are late, please check back on this web page for the exact location. We shall update when we settle on a spot.
