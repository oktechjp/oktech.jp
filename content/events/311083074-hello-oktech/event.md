OK... *What*? üôÄ Save the date! We celebrate! OK... **Tech**! üòé

Join us for the first official **OKTech** *Osaka Meetup*! We are ditching our super-long name for something easier to remember that gives more flexibility to do things. New Name, New Logo, New Homepage!

*Come and celebrate with us! ü•Ç*

For our first official event we do something different! Meet us *for non-alcoholic drinks* and light networking at a special venue! Besides meeting interesting people we will also share a little with you what happened in the past years, how the logo and homepage came together and one or another technical note as well.

Is this a paid event? Yes, but **two mocktails are included with the price**! üç∏ Also, we will see to get some snacks to you. Stay tuned for updates!

We would be very happy if you could join and celebrate with us our the first proper **OKTech** Meetup!

Until then, see you [in Discord!](https://owddm.com/discord/)
