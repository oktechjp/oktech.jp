Are you a software engineer who enjoys digging into new ideas, practices, and patterns that strengthen your craft? Join us for the next **OKTech Study Session**, a gathering for engineers who don’t just code, but want to understand the *why* and *how* behind solid software design.

In the second session in a 3-part series on **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** we’ll move into **collaborative modeling**. Using a brand-new product idea as our case study, we’ll work with a *domain expert* to explore how DDD helps us shape software through a shared understanding of the problem space.

Whether you’re completely new to DDD or looking to sharpen your understanding, these sessions are designed to help you take your first steps toward using DDD in practice. It is not a problem to join only one of the sessions, but this series builds on previous sessions. **Therefore we encourage you to join all three to get the most out of it.**

Session description:

1. Not Another Acronym? -> Explaining the basic concepts of DDD
2. **A New Product Emerges -> Start Domain Modelling together**
3. DDD in Practice -> Explore ways to introduce DDD in your company
