Spring is still in the air, but summer is now just around the corner. We hope that you enjoyed your holidays and had a truly golden week. With a little delay, we are happy to announce the next Designers and Developers meetup taking place on May 27 at the usual location, kindly provided by Aiming Inc.

Update 5/19: As promised, this month we are bringing together another two great design professionals who share their insights.

Following the highly-appreciated presentation about Sketch, Mathieu Mayer (http://mx3m.github.io/) - who is a front-end designer at AQ - will show us with real world examples how to make interactive prototypes using Principle, another app built for mac OS.

Rica Hayakawa (http://rica.cc/), a graphic designer specialized in puppet illustration and animation, will show us how to design characters and will draw parallels between character design in Japan and in the rest of the world.

Don’t forget to RSVP and please join us for a great day, packed with tools and discussions that will expand your design horizons.

As usual, after the meetup we will go to a nearby Izakaya for some drinks and some more relaxing chat. Looking forward to see you on May 27 at 6PM, Aiming Inc!
