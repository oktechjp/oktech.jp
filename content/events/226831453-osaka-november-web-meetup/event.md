Hello Web creatives,

The cool rain covers silently prepares us for the winter. In that spirit I changed our meeting time back to our winter setting and we shall meet again at 16:00 on Sat. the 28th. As promised I was looking to find a different meeting space for us which is why this announcement slightly late but we have now the Aiming (http://aiming-inc.com/en/about/access/) Inc's meeting space in the GrandFront North towers 18th floor! I am looking forward to have this month's conversation there!

While we are at the topic:
Luna is preparing a presentation on Responsive design and we can welcome a special guest this month! Jessica Rose (from DreamFactory (https://www.dreamfactory.com/)) is travelling in Japan and the timing fits so she will be talking about Reusable APIs and Development Patterns for the web.

As usual we welcome Web developers and designers and other web professionals from Osaka or other corners of Kansai to join us in our lively conversations on wide-ranging topics.

I am looking forward to the presentations and hope you will join us too!

best regards
Martin Heidegger

Note: After the meetup we usually go out for drinks and socializing to a nearby izakaya, now that we are in wintertime we will have it maybe a little cozier.
