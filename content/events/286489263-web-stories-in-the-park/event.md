**Important Note**: The Weather forecast looks like it should hold with a light chance for rain. We will still be at the meeting point but maybe we need to divert the meetup later on.

Summer is here! To avoid meeting in closed spaces we will have another picnic in the park.

As presentations in the open are difficult, we thought to try a new idea: **Share and listen to stories** from the world of web development. ðŸ¤¯

To make it collaborative, we hope that everyone who joins can prepare a short story to tell to the others. If you can't that is fine too, but you will need to cheer really hard for the others! ðŸ˜œ

The format is as follows:

* There has to be a connection to web development, but it can be about any part of it: SEO, money, workfow, customers, code, ux issues, bosses... ðŸ˜²
* You have 5\~10 minutes.
* It has to have happened, but it is okay if it didn't happen to you.
* There has to be a punch line. (A thing that you ...learned/received/changed/etc. ... because of it.)

A sneak peak for one story:

I was a front-end developer at the time and we didn't have a back-ender to help us out. The server hosting was arranged beforehand and it didn't support any server side scripting but was just a simple Apache server. What to do? I figured it would be best to... *(to be continued)*

Intrigued? ðŸ˜‰ Awesome!

Besides a story, please bring a mat to sit on and your own food and drinks. Families are welcome.

Meeting point: at the gate of the Tsurumi-ryokuchi Station on the Nagahori Tsurumi-ryokuchi line.

There is a Lawson close to the station. You can get food and drinks there.

If you are late, please check back on this web page for the exact location.
