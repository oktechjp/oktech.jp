The new space worked out well last time! As it was providing a big space to escape the summer sun we will be meeting there in August again. ðŸ˜Ž

Before going into the meetup: We have started a Survey to figure out what you are up to and how we could make a nicer meetup for you. It would be awesome if you could take a few minutes to make our life easier âž¡ï¸Ž [Survey for OWDDM members](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfzo6DecghqIfir5O-2eiuQXPf81j97XcOCVEr6eJgUSEGeMw/viewform).

This month, the Alexey from the amazing [Evil Martians](https://evilmartians.com/) *(inspiration for the meetup name)* is going to talk about Code. Not about a particular piece of code but about ***"writing code that other people like to read"***. Since Evil Martians maintains a lot of OpenSource projects, he will surely be able to share a lot of insight. *(whole description at the end)*

Also, James is going to continue his **collaborative** **live-coding session** from last time and work on the new OWDDM webpage - designed by Kimmy.

And there is still space/time for another presentation. If you have something you want to talk about: please don't hesitate to contact us!

Looking forward to meet you this month!

Description for Alexeys Presentation:

*Writing code that works and writing code that other people can read and understand are two different skills. And writing code that other people could read and understand became more and more essential skill as the projects grew larger and more people began working on it.*

*But because it is a skill, you need to train it consciously. It's a lot like writing essays and books. Almost everyone can write letters and words, and many people can also connect them in grammatically correct sentences, but just writing grammatically correct sentences is not enough to make them pleasant and easy to read.*

*An essential part of learning writing skills is reading and analyzing other people's code on the one hand and making other people read your code and give you feedback about it.*

*I will talk about different methods to make programmers better writers and how to train in the skill of writing code that other people would want to read.*
