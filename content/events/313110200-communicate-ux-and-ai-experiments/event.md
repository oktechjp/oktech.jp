Join us for this February we are coping with the trends of the last year and look at AI through two different lenses.

In **Communicating with Stakeholders as a UI/UX Designer**, Kimmy shows how UI/UX designers add value beyond AI. While AI can generate interfaces, it can’t fully grasp user needs or navigate stakeholder perspectives. The session focuses on using communication and critical thinking to create better experiences and guide product decisions.

Tillman and Chris join forces to answer the question: **What is tracking me?** A project involving hardware and software that lifts veil on who or what is collecting your data when you are in public even without any digital devices. Big brother, we're watching you.

Bring an open mind and join us for out February Meetup.
