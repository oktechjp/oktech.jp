The cold days are over, and before we rush into Golden Week we have another nice Meetup in April while the last Cherry trees bloom. I would like to invite you to meet like-minded Web Designers and Developers and join us for two nice presentations and optionally some drinks afterwards.

This time will be about JavaScript. Yeah, I know what you are thinking. "Not another weird framework." But this time should be different, because we have exceptional speakers with actual solutions to improve comfort in the increasingly irritating world of JavaScript.

We are honored to have Sacha Greif with us. He is the Co-Author of "Discover Meteor", entrepreneur and long time hacker community activist. He will be presenting Vulcan.js, his latest project to make next-generation, full-stack projects quickly and in a breeze.

After that, Frank Xu - excellent developer from Shanghai - will show us how he "Makes JavaScript easy again" using little tricks, and will shine a light on things that simply are way more complex than they need be.

Of course we will have some time to chat during the event and will be hanging out at an Izakaya afterwards.

We are looking forward to have you!
