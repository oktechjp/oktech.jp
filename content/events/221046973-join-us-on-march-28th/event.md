While we are waiting on the spring to show up, lets have another meetup in march!

As usually we have open discussions with people of many fields: graphic designing, DBA (Database Admins), HTML, PHP, CSS experts, those that have had experiences setting up business in Japan, crowd-sourcing or outsourcing, successful collaborations and we most certainly welcome you.

For this meeting, Mr. Christian Oliff will prepare a talk about high performance html and perhaps we can get a "podium discussion" on "differences in web development and use from the point of various countries" running: https://github.com/owddm/presentations/issues/1 (any volunteers?)

On the topic of presentations: we are trying something new! You can now share your thoughts and ideas on what we are doing at Github: https://github.com/owddm/presentations/issues

In case you want to help out with things: just comment here: https://github.com/owddm/kickoff/issues/1 and we will add you to the owners list.

Also if the talks and presentations aren't enough: there is usually a completely informal get-together afterwards!

If you are interested in talking about whatever-that-strike-your-fancy over drinks or food please join. Up until now we have been looking for restaurants ad-hoc but because Saturdays are busy, we ask before-hands if you want to attend to make sure that we can reserve somewhere nice.

Thank you and looking forward to see you!
