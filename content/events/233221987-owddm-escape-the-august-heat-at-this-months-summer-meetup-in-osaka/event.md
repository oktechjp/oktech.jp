Web developers and designers from Kansai: you are welcome to join us for this month's summer meetup. All you need to bring is an open mind and an interest in the web, regardless of experience and background. Yes, we welcome you even if you are a total beginner and you want to have an insight into web design or development!

This month’s agenda is yet to be determined as we are still looking to lock in speakers for the event. We usually have a wide range of topics and this meetup will be no exception.

We have two more seats available for speakers, so please let us know if you have something to share. Do you have an insight on the following topics: making code scalable, 3d augmented design, trends on UI/ UX design or maybe just some recent work you are proud of and wish to share it with us? Please get in touch! We look forward to your presentation!

After the meetup we will go out to a near-by Izakaya for drinks and post-meetup socializing. This will be a great opportunity to make new connections, especially for newcomers!

We hope to see you on Aug 27 at 6PM, at our usual venue kindly provided each time by Aiming Inc.

Until then, stay cool, stay frosty :)
