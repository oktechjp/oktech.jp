Summer is coming!

First meeting after the golden week, it presumably will be significantly warmer and a result of that we will start at 18:00! (actually its because I couldn't get the meeting space before that, but maybe its a good chance to establish a summer time between may and october?)

As usually we have open discussions with people of many fields: graphic designing, DBA (Database Admins), HTML, PHP, CSS experts, those that have had experiences setting up business in Japan, crowd-sourcing or outsourcing, successful collaborations and we most certainly welcome you!

Right now the meetings are not yet planned, if you want to hear about something or want to present something just post a new issue on github: https://github.com/owddm/presentations/issues

We are having an organisation setup on github . If you feel like helping, having a problem or taking over the task please let me know! We are also looking for help. https://github.com/owddm/organization/issues

If you are interested in talking about whatever-that-strike-your-fancy over drinks or food please join. Last time we were able to reserve the place we usually go, which is a nice little improvement!

Thank you and looking forward to see you!
