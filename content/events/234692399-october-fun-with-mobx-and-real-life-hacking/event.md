Dear designers and developers,

As the new season is progressing, we would like to extend an invitation to join us this month for our Mid-autumn Meetup. You are welcome to join us at our usual venue kindly provided by Aiming Inc. located in the Grand Front North towers.

Freshly arrived in Japan, Vincent Prouillet from We Are Wizards (https://wearewizards.io/) would like to continue last months presentation on state in JavaScript with a 30 minute session about Mobx. Mobx is a simple and scalable state management solution mostly used with React.

Long time Osakan artisan (http://code-artisan.io/) Florent Btd. from Cookbiz (https://cookbiz.jp/) will touch upon the Security topic with his 30 minute introduction on the actual hacking of websites. Real life hacking 101.

After the meetup we will go out to a nearby Izakaya for drinks and post-meetup socializing. There will be an opportunity to network with like-minded developers, designers and enthusiasts.

We hope to see you on October 22, 2016 at 6PM.

See you there!
