Woohoo, January at C2 Kyoto was awesome, Let's do that in February again!

This time, Martin will be talking about React. As he is working on React projects in 2024, he noticed that many basics still are unclear to folks and so he will introduce common stumble points he noticed and important other things he learnt while using React in production in 2024. Yippey!

At the C2 in Kyoto we will be having a chance to socialize over drinks. Until then, join us in the [â†’ Discord](https://owddm.com/discord) to share your thoughts and suggest new topics for 2024!

We look forward to welcoming you soon! ðŸ‘‹
