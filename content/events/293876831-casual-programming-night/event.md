Join us for our first _"Programming night"_: a smaller and more casual event. Talk and work together on code in a relaxed environment.

All expertise levels and backgrounds are welcome! Come to practice your English, learn a new Programming Language, talk about ReactJS, VueJS, Python, ML, Rust, Databases, Docker, IoT, or something else you're interested in!
