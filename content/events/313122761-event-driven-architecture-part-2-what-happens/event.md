**Event-Driven Architecture: From Communication to Reality (3-Part Workshop Series)**

Are you a software engineer who enjoys digging into new ideas, practices, and patterns that strengthen your craft? Join us for the next **OKTech Study Session**, a gathering for engineers who don’t just code, but want to understand the _why_ and _how_ behind solid software design.

**Session Summary:** Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) promises loose coupling, scalability, and flexibility. In practice, it also introduces new kinds of complexity, subtle failure modes, and long-term maintenance challenges. In this three-part workshop series, we’ll explore EDA from first principles to real-world operation. The focus is on **architectural decisions, trade-offs, and consequences,** not on tools or frameworks.

### Part 1 – How do event systems communicate? (done)

Starting with the fundamentals of communication in distributed systems:

- Synchronous vs asynchronous communication
- Events vs commands (and why the distinction matters)
- Pub/Sub, Point-to-Point, Request-Reply, and Streaming patterns

**Goal:** Build a clear mental model of communication styles and understand how each choice affects the system.

### Part 2 – What happens when things go wrong? (current)

Because in distributed systems, failure is given:

- Poison messages and failing consumers
- Idempotency and duplicate delivery
- Out-of-order events
- Delivery guarantees

**Goal:** Learn how to design event-driven systems that assume failure and remain reliable when unexpected things happen.

### Part 3 – How to maintain an EDA?

Once the system is running, the real challenges begin:

- Monitoring and correlating event flows
- Event versioning and documentation
- Testing event communication

**Goal:** Understand how to keep an event-driven system observable, evolvable, and maintainable over time.

### How do we work?

- Small group to encourage discussion and participation
- Concept- and practice-focused, not tool-specific
- Interactive discussions and exercises
- The sessions build on each other, so attending all three is strongly recommended

### Who is it for?

- Software engineers with **2–3+ years of professional experience**
- Developers working on backend or distributed systems
- Engineers who have used events before, or expect to work with them soon
- People who want to reason about architecture, not just apply patterns by name

You don’t need to be an EDA expert, but some hands-on software engineering experience is expected.
