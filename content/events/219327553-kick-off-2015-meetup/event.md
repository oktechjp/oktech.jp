2015 starts and the web prevails and we continue on our journeys! So: Let's Meetup for nice discussions with peers, new opinions and interesting dissections about all things trending and/or crazy in our daily challenges to survive the rapid progress.

Right now it looks like James will be talking about "Why you shouldn't use Wordpress" and Kenji about "Dealing with DB, ORM, MVC". *But!* This time we setup a discussion board at loomio (because it seems to work quite nicely) so you can have a voice in what comes up!

Hope to see you all well and healthy in January!

PS.: Martin has been very busy the past weeks and thats why it took a while to get this setup. If you feel like you can write this sort of text better than him, setup discussions etc. then your support would be welcome :)

PPS.: This site is still very raw. It would be awesome if we had a nice banner/logo. Do you need an outlet for your creativity?
