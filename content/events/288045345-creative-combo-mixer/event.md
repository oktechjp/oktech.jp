Hello Everyone, this is an unexpected event! Surprise

Friends from the [Creative Tokyo](https://www.meetup.com/creative-tokyo/) are visiting Osaka and we are having a first mixer.

**What we will be doing ?** Meet each other & talk: designers, PMs, developers - everyone is welcome!

We invite you to join us in **meeting** other people interested in (web-)design and have a bit of a nice time together.

Join us in visiting the [Hue Coffee](https://www.instagram.com/hue_coffee_roaster/), an event space designed by Kimura-san from [Starryworks](https://www.starryworks.co.jp) (here is [his article on the design process](https://note.com/kjkmr/n/n9464c9951eec)) who will open longer just for us.

We won't have an attendance fee, but we need to ask you to have a drink - which should be quite pleasurable üçπ

*Please Note:* there will be **no alcoholic drinks** at the venue but we will have mocktails and other tasty options.
