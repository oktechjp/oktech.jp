Finally, Spring is here and the warm days are starting! Before the long golden week holiday, we would like to invite you to our April Meetup for two nice talks and optionally some drinks afterward in a nearby Izakaya.

First up - Oussama Ladhari, a web developer in Miraidenshi Technology, will talk about Docker and how to mount an application (frontend/backend) with docker-compose, and why Dockerizing an application is very important nowadays.

Then Andrew Zamora, a web developer in Mamamia, will talk to us about his career change from English teacher to a full-stack web developer and how he made this change possible.

As always, you can ask your questions as well as having a break for chatting during the event

Please go ahead and book your time!

See you soon!
