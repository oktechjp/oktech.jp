Hello friends,

as you may have heard: [we have had our first earthquake warning](https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Natural-disasters/Japan-s-Nankai-Trough-earthquake-advisory-5-things-to-know)! Now that the immediate alert has been lifted, doesn't mean that we can 100% relax.

To be prepared, we decided something different and have a little walking & talking day in Osaka. All steps are optional, you can depart at any time and join if you can catch us. Martin starts in the morning.

* 9:45 - We meet at [Awaza Station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pfmw4TvgJGcsTF128) (Exit 8)
* 10:00 - Enter the [Tsunami Surge and Disaster Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aBuZsbPqyrS1CWax7) *(entrance free)* to see what Osaka has been thinking about what to do when an earthquake strikes.
* \~ 11:45 - Go to the excellent [Takamura Wine and Coffee roasters](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2y76nmgYJbXd3oNb6) *(the venue is quite big, and there should be space for us)* for coffee and a light snack - Talk about our thoughts on disaster prevention, SpaceLink and other things.
* \~ 13:30 - We go to the nearby [Ostec Exhibition Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/teXvcG9Sd2LRWnMn6) *(entrance free)* a neat little science center that vibes with Martin.
* \~ 15:00 - We use the [Midosuji Line (240yen)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/L4ngbLPiZMWj4ZPGA) to get to the [Abeno Tasukaru Disaster Prevention Learning Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zi9bFeoZyzS4GZxm9) *(entrance free)*
* \~ 17:00 - We either go out for drinks or back home.

So, join us for a day of Disaster Prevention learning in order to work on our organizational safety for the tech staff. ðŸ˜‰
