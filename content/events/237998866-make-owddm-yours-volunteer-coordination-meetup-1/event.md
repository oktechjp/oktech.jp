Hello Osaka Web Developers & Designers,

To make the organization of the events in this meetup group clearer and more public, we start with this meetup our yearly session of coordination meetups.

In this meetup Martin will have 30 minutes to explain everything you need to know if you want to volunteer and is available for another 30 minute Q&A.

Please join us if you feel like you want to contribute or if you are simple interested in hearing how we work.

cheers and best regards
Martin Heidegger
