Dear all,

as we are approaching the end of this season and indeed the end of the year, November gives us the opportunity to meet for one more time and share insightful knowledge at OWDDM.

Even though we are still setting up the details, we can offer a preview of whatâ€™s to come: Florent Btd, code artisan and an old friend of OWWDM, will be with us this month and will share his knowledge on hacking. This month he will be talking about Ethical Hacking, for fun and profit. Interesting!

So Join Us!

After the meetup we will go to a nearby place for some drinks and post-meetup socializing.

We hope to see you on Saturday November 25, 2017 at 6PM. This month we are meeting at Cybozu Osaka Office, situated in Hankyu Umeda Office building at the 35th floor.

See you there!
