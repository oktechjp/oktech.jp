The March is on!

If you have joined our Meetups in the past, you might have noticed an auspicious lack of Ruby. After all, ruby is said to be very popular in Japan and many companies use it. However in the past we havn't had other presenters on the topic.

This month Andrey will help us mitigate that and give an update on Ruby, what things are happening and how the situation looks like.

In our second presentation, Munchou will be talking about one of his interests: data parsing. Using Python he will give us an introduction in data parsing techniques and how to apply them in practice. (→ [Thread](https://discord.com/channels/1034792577293094972/1314963744706658375))
