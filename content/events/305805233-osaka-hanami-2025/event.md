Let's enjoy spring together!

***Notice:*** _Due to a cold weather forecast, our plans have changed and now the Hanami will be on **Sunday April 6th**._

The winter has passed and to spend a day in the sun to forget the winter is one of the best things in Japan. Bring some snacks, a good mood and let's enjoy a day under the cherry trees!
Let's touch grass together and make new connections.
But before we do that, **we have a few ground rules:**

* Please bring your mat to sit on
* Please bring your preferred snacks and drinks
* Please clean up after yourself
* Be kind

*Note:* Depending on the weather forecast and cherry's bloom we may update the date to be on April 5th.
