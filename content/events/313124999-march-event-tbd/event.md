Spring is knocking at the door and before this fiscal year ends we are having a special event.

Join us for an evening of building things. In this beginner friendly, hands-on event we learn from _Allen_ the basics of hardware development to **"Get started Making"**.
During this 3h event we will be having basic presentations and hands-on experience with hardware parts.

We will prepare build kits for 1500JPY. The event itself is **free of charge** but if you don't request your own build kit during RSVP, you likely need to work with together with other attendees on one build kit!

The build kits are in preparation but will likely be a two transistor oscillator on a breadboard. Look at → [this Discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/1034792577293094972/1463532613066031145) for updates or questions around the event.
