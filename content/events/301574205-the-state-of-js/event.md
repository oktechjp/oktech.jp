Hello there fellow OWDDMers ðŸ‘¾

It's another hot and humid month but we've made it to July.

We welcome back Sacha to give a presentation on the recently released [State of JS](https://2023.stateofjs.com/en-US) 2023 survey results at this month's meetup. If you're curious about the recent innovations within JS, you won't be short of satisfied. He will also cover the recently released State of React survey results!

Join us at the Cybozu office for a presentation and networking with fellow developers and designers. Come with your questions and curiosity surrounding JS, and if you're lucky, other programming languages!

We are always looking for volunteers to hold workshops and give presentations. If you have something you want to share with or teach to your fellows in the tech community, please reach out to us. If you are a community member who wants to participate in a workshop, this is your time to shine!
