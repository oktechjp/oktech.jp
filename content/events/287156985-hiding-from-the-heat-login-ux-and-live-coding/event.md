Summer heat in Osaka, and we meet to escape the blistering sun and talk about web & things. ðŸ˜Ž

This month we are trying a new meeting space. This should be easier to access for many and we hope you enjoy it. ðŸ˜‰

This month, Martin will be taking a deeper look at the Login and New-User process of web services. Attempting to identify the difference between **logins, old and new** variants from an user-experience and security perspective.

This should keep us in conversation and busy for a while, but if the preparations work out, James is also going to do some frontend live-coding on the OWDDM homepage. ðŸ¤¯

There is still space/time for another presentation. If you have something you want to talk about: please don't hesitate to contact us!

We are still in the process of re-invigorating this meetup. As such, it would be awesome if you could take a few minutes and share what you think about it:
