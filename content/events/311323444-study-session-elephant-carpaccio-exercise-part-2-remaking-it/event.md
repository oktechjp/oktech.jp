Are you a software engineer who enjoys digging into new ideas, practices, and patterns that strengthen your craft? Join us for the next **OKTech Study Session**, a gathering for engineers who don’t just code, but want to understand the *why* and *how* behind solid software design.

This **second session** let us put the elephant back together during a **practice with fast-paced implementation**. Working in pairs, you’ll take the tiny user stories you defined and bring them to life in short, timed sprints. Each slice must be demo-able, so you’ll experience first-hand the discipline of finishing thin, valuable increments **under real-world pressure**.

**What you’ll do:**

* Implement ultra-thin user stories in 5 × 8-minute coding rounds.
* Practice TDD and pair programming to keep pace and code quality high.
* Demo progress at the end of each round.
* Reflect on the balance between speed, consistency, and design.

**Session difficulty:** Junior Engineer or Product Related (familiarity with basic software developer is helpful).

**IMPORTANT!** This session includes hands-on coding. Bring a laptop with your development setup ready (it's done in pairs).

**Meeting Content:**

* Introduction
* Explain the subject
* Coding exercise
* Discussion
* Feedback & Wrap-up

**Discussion Style:**

* Raise your hand when you’d like to speak
* Keep each contribution to a maximum of 2 minutes
