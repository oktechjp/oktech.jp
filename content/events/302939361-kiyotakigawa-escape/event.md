Hello Friends,

Getting out at the weekend and talk over tech while on a hike can be a nice balance between learning new things and moving one's body. Also, In hot Kyoto its nice to get out as we recently figured out when we went to [Ishiyamadera](https://www.meetup.com/kyoto-web-designers-and-developers-meetup/events/302842348/).

In this extra-curricular event [Sacha](https://sachagreif.com/) is guiding us through Kyoto's mountains along the Kiyotaki river.

9:32 Meet at [JR Hozukyo Station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nbDJYZD5nUHVEm9n9)
\~11:00 Pass the [Atago Torii Gate](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Dxb933ZpopJtn6Jm8) in Kiyotaki Village
\~12:30 Visit the [Kuya Waterfall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/G9YkJjtxryiaX96i7)
\~16:00 Visit [Saimyo temple](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KsDUTLFNJwPLahUa7) (optional, visit the main hall for 500yen)
\~16:30 Return via [Takao Bus Station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CJmjpmEuPGVs6n8X6) to Kyoto Center

**Note**: there is a bus going back from Kiyotaki Village to Arashiyama, so it's possible to **just do the first half** of the hike.

Please bring lunch and enough to drink. There may also be mosquitos and hot sun at the day. Also, if you want to head for a swim (there are multiple beautiful swimming spots along the river): swimwear and a towel might be a good idea.

*Note:* Children welcome since the path is almost entirely flat and easy to walk, but it's a longer hike. It would be good if they are used to it.
