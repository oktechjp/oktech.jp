More React in March, but this time with a twist and more ðŸ˜±. Join us for this month, for a longer evening with two smaller workshops!

In the first hour, Jake will dive with *"Sky High Code: Building and Monetizing MSFS Aircraft with React and WASM"* into the cutting-edge world of Microsoft Flight Simulator development, where we will learn how to use React for intuitive UI/UX design and WebAssembly (WASM) for high-performance in-simulation experiences. *(More in our [discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/1034792577293094972/1205677359550701598)).*

Please, also bring a computer with more than 16G of RAM if you want to participate in our second workshop, later in the evening. We can learn together with Eduardo, how to set up a local LLM *(large language model)*. Get a hands-on experience on how to modern AI works. *(For questions, here is [the Discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/1034792577293094972/1202785893925261382))*

At the C2 in Kyoto we will be having a chance to socialize over drinks. Until then, here is the [â†’ Discord Invite](https://owddm.com/discord) to share your thoughts and suggest new topics for 2024!

We look forward to welcoming you soon! ðŸ‘‹
