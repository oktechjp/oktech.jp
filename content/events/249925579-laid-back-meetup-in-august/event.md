Dear all, we hope you are fully enjoying the summer holidays. For those of you who didn't make any plans for the end of the month, no worries. We booked the room at Aiming Inc for a new designers & devs meetup, on Saturday August 25th between 6PM - 8PM.

We are still looking for speakers! If you are interested to present please let us and we will accommodate you. We will update this page as soon as we have all the details, but until then feel free to hit the CONFIRM button.

Updated: James McGrath, a front end freelancer and friend of OWDDM will talk about the essential CSS concepts you should know and master as a web developer, while I will share with you the two logistics and inventory management apps I've been contributing to at Bento&co

As usual, after the meetup we will go to a nearby izakaya for some drinks and some more socializing.

See you soon!
