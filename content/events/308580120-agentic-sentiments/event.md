Big buzzwords are on the menu for this Summer where we are happy to invite both techy and non-techy people.

[Karim](https://github.com/greenstorm) will be looking into a language processing topic and check out a classic machine learning topic which have become much easier. In his presentation on *"Japanese Text Classification with Sentiment Analysis"* he will show how to automatically try to understand japanese text. [→Thread](https://discord.com/channels/1034792577293094972/1323896484051030016)

After that, in a pretty modern topic, [クリス](https://クリス.コム/) will be tackling a "Agentic Coding". He is looking at how to use AI agents to write code for you to avoid writing code yourself. [→ Thread](https://discord.com/channels/1034792577293094972/1365473022508535828)
