In April, many start their new jobs and we figure its a great time to talk about something a little different.

We invited the [General Union](https://generalunion.org/?lang=en) to inform us how unions work in Japan and in particular what this could mean for us in the tech field. We are grateful for them join us and hope you will use opportunity.

Furthermore, we are happy for [Nithin Coca](https://www.nithincoca.com/), a Nara-based freelance journalist who's written for Engadget, Coda Story, The Wire China, and elsewhere, to join us with a presentation on their reporting and investigations on censorship, hacking and digital surveillance in China, Southeast Asia, and Japan. (→ [Thread](https://discord.com/channels/1034792577293094972/1325635204043509822))

These are two very special presentations and we hope you find the time to join us.

We are looking forward for you to join us at the date and until then, see you in → [Discord](https://owddm.com/discord)
