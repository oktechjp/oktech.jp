Our last event this year is just before christmas🥂🎄with lovely presentations!

The end of the year is coming quickly and this is a time to huddle together and company of friends. For this occasion we are happy to have two interesting presenters join us.

Join the → [Discord Thread](https://discord.com/channels/1034792577293094972/1438331659517694092) and share what sector you are in if you want some special preparations!

_Tilmann_, our security specialist, will be talking about how to deal with _"Developer credentials and how to find them"_ - a timely topics as hacking of companies becomes a somewhat daily occurrence. (→ [Discord Thread](https://discord.com/channels/1034792577293094972/1409388395033002055))

And finally, we'll have an **end-of-year potluck**. Bring your favorite snack*, homemade or not, and share it with the group. Bonus points if it's something none of us have eaten before! 🍪🐛🍦
