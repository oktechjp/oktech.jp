  We'll meet in front of the Uji sightseeing guide map in front of the Uji Keihan Station. 

  (Note: make sure you come to the **Uji Keihan station**, and not the Uji JR station, which is a 5-min walk away on the other side of the river)

Now that complaining-about-the-heat season (a.k.a. summer) is over, and before complaining-about-the-cold season (a.k.a. winter) starts, let's take a second to enjoy Kansai's beautiful fall colors.

We'll explore Uji and its mountains, walk through the forest all the way to Amagase Dam and then make our way on the other side of the Uji river.

We should be back in town early enough to get a matcha latte, parfait, cake, or basically anything you want as long as it's matcha-flavored – that's kind of Uji's thing.
