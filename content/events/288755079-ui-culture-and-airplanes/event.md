Dear web enthusiasts, we're in a busy autumn! 🔥

Our organizer *Kimmy* will be exploring in **"Western vs Japanese UI Design - a comparison"** about the differences in the design trends between *western* and *japanese* UI design and explore some possible explanations on this. 👩‍🎨

Following that, our first time presenter's *Jacob* is planning to give in **"Flight Sim Development: Not just for AV Otakus"** an overview on the advancement of home flight simulators ✈️ over the past few decades, share insights on how open source development is linked with modern versions, and how everyone from beginners, to seasoned engineers can cut their teeth with these projects.

This month we are going to try a new experience a little bit. We organized a Machiya meeting room to have our meetup in. Let's see how that style works.

*Also: You are not having a Deja'vu 🐈‍⬛ !* This is the [same event plan](https://www.meetup.com/osaka-web-designers-and-developers-meetup/events/288595894) as we are having in Osaka. Both Kimmy and Jacob would like to practice their presentation twice and since they are both okay with it, we thought to give it a try.

For November we have already a little planned, but if you feel like sharing your knowledge then feel free to [propose a presentation](https://forms.gle/umcRKdEy9SekLQL68)! 📥

Feedback has been trickling in and we are looking into a way to share it with everyone. Until then, know that we take it by heart, so if there is something on your mind, feel free to share it ↓
