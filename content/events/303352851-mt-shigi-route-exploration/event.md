Hello Friends, ðŸ‘‹

next year in June *(still a while out)*, there is the [Music Ai Hackathon](https://music-ai-hackathon.com/) and at the time Martin would like to hike to the there with a few attendees. To prepare for this, Martin would like to explore the hiking routes up to the [Gyokuzo Temple](https://gyokuzo.com/en/). From the west, six possible routes make sense up the mountain.

\- A: Starting from [Hattorigawa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/71sHYgrL3MTVQCKX6) station, the most cultural route passes by the [Yao Museum of History and Folklore](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mYRWnhor33PAxZSBA) and a few other cultural relics and on the route passes [Mizunomijizoin](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BypmGSzGSpjvfuC37) which seems to have a gorgeous view. This route is also quite long and reaches the Temple from the north.
\- B: The easiest and obvious route would be from [Shigisan-guchi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xFzt5H2BrYjYHRfXA) station or - using the Cable-car - [Takasuyama](https://maps.app.goo.gl/toUJ9NoXZAPmLskH9) Station. Direct would be super-short and skip the mountain ascension.
\- C: The easiest by train but also the longest starts at [JR Kashiwara](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CNTTJMaonGZJw3eo7) station. It passes by the seemingly quite beautiful, [Nudehiko Shrine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/W1EZsLh9JxP6ZHjS6) and a big power station.
\- D: The fourth route passes starts from [Onji station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JEANPH7CfgG9wsCM8), passes the [Chakichian culture house](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WB51FmDmfzubUav57) (with a nice cafe) and the [Onji Shrine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GgaCP95Anzd6Wu268) \- which looks lovely \- before winding up the hill\, a medium length route it seems\.
\- E: From the south\, taking the unconventional [Kawachi-Katakami](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2F4S2vgkeDEVxSKE7) Station, it is possible to stop by the very interesting looking [Landslide Infrastructure Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/g56XyvHchntpP9Pq7) (they have free guided tours), before taking a relatively relaxed but longer route, passing a few lesser known shrines.
\- F: \(Specially interesting in April\) the Route starting from [Shigisan-shita](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ivadXAnKycQkDURq8) and passing by a famous, steep [road with a thousand cherry trees](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Bmo6Ch84z72N6McVA) might be the most touristic one. Martin went there before, its nice but also a bit underwhelming.

Anyways, this time the plan is to use route A+B. Having a look at the museum before hiking up the mountain and having a look at the main temple before tracking back to the the cable car station and heading down to the west.

8:45 Meeting at [Hattorigawa Station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/N5A5MTgfniAE3P8H8)
9:00 Enter [Yao Museum of History and Folklore](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EBwgSMkFHps1wXSG7)
10:00 Meeting outside the Museum for those who want to skip it.
11:45 Bento Lunch at [Mizunomijizoin](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BUDcxBfv92MRsXvf7) \- \(Bring it with you\!\)
14:00 Heading to [Benzaiten Falls](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3quqykyUM6YhvQxr5)
14:20 Arrival at the [Chogosonshi-ji](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NEghQK9EyTotDEA17) entrance *(hop-on point for people who want to take a different route)*
15:30 Finish visiting of the Temple area.
17:05 Last cable car down

This is the plan for now, lets talk more on [â†’ Discord](https://owddm.com/discord) in the *#meet-irl* channel.
