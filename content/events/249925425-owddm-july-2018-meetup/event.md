We hope you're enjoying the summer and are ready for the 46th Osaka Web Designer/Developer Meetup.

We're delighted to have Marcel Takagi, VP of Product at Hacarus and co-organizer of the Kyoto Startup Weekend joining us to give a talk about the 'Double Diamond' design process for innovation.

Christian Oliff, Webmaster at ALK Technologies will show us '100 Things to Check Before You Launch a Website' - best practices covering usability, accessibility, SEO, security, performance and more.

We're back at GVH#5 - The Hive's meeting room in Umeda again.
