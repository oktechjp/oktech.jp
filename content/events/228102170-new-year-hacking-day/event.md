Happy New Year Websters!

The year has turned, we have 2016 and the time has come to talk web again! Because it's a new year and because the Remote Year (http://www.remoteyear.com/) is Kansai this month January I thought we have a day of Web hacking together. One afternoon where we pick a topic to learn/work on and evening have a short presentation on it. For the fun and love of design/html/http/json or whatever moves your mind.

The attendance this time is a little different. We will start at noon and in the evening have a set of presentations before we go out for drinks. It is okay to join us later (say around 17:00) for presentation round-ups. You can hack together or alone. If you are looking for others to join you it would be nice if you could share your interest in the comments so maybe others can join you.

We meet this month again at the Aiming office. They have been so kind to offer their shiny, new office in the new Tower B.

Looking forward to next week!
