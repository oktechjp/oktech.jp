Come escape the summer heat with Eduardo & Jake at the MoneyForward office in Kyoto!

For this session Eduardo will be discussing Omega Programming, a proposed framework for how to enhance the **programming workflow** between autonomous agents, and humans.

Afterwards, Jake will be delving into the world of fonts and typography, with a hands on interactive demo and surprise towards the end.

A special thank you to @luccafort and [MoneyForward](https://kyoto.moneyforward.com/en/) for lending us this space!
