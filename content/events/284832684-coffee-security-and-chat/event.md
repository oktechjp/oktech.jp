We will be very happy to see you at the next Meetup, our first meeting of the year.

Just to get together, chat about security in an enterprise environment and trade ideas/connections.

At this time, the **slots for Presentations are still open**.

So if you would like to:

* present a lightning talk or
* moderate a talk or
* sell an idea/service, or
* seek collaboration over a project you are working on,

do let any of the Organizers know.

Thanks.

P.S: It's **bring-your-own-coffee** kinda of a place though.
