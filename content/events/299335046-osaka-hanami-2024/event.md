Another event in Osaka? Yes! 👽

The weather is getting warmer, and with spring nearly here? The cherry blossoms will be blooming very soon! How about we have a hanami in Osaka on March 30th? From 11 to 3 pm, we want to gather all of our interested tech community members for a lovely day out. No more being cramped in an office! It’s time to touch grass with our peers!

Let’s relax under the Sakura trees and make new connections.

But before we do that, **we have a few ground rules:**

* Please bring your mat to sit on
* Please bring your preferred snacks and drinks
* Please clean up after yourself
* Be kind
