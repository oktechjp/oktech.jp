Hello friends,

between the cherry blossoms blooming and golden week flying in we are happy to invite you to another *very* cool topic.

In April, we will get to know Tauri which is getting its 2.0 release soon. [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) is an App framework that allows us to build applications for Desktop and Mobile using web technologies ðŸ¤©

We will be learning from [Tillmann](https://github.com/tweidinger) \- the Security Engineer of Tauri \- about how the security concepts of Tauri help develop any secure app\. With a small workshop\, we can learn how to build apps ourselves\. *(More in our [discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/1034792577293094972/1209041811536871486)).*

At C2 in Kyoto, we will also have a chance to socialize over drinks. Until then, here is the [â†’ Discord Invite](https://owddm.com/discord) to share your thoughts and suggest new topics for 2024!

We look forward to welcoming you soon! ðŸ‘‹
