The [Live Coding Collective](https://www.meetup.com/vibe-coders-collective/) from the UK is visiting Osaka and we are happy to join this [social coding jam](https://www.meetup.com/vibe-coders-collective/events/312063796/) where we use AI to quickly turn fun ideas into functional prototype.

### Who is this for?
Curious coders, tinkerers, designers, artists, entrepreneurs, and anyone who wants to explore AI-powered creativity in a fun, social pub setting. Whether you’re an experienced developer or have never written a line of code, you’ll fit right in.
Locals, expats, and travelers are all welcome!

Use **any AI tools** you like (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, Google AI Studio, etc.).

- **The Goal:** Vibe, learn from each other, and see where the collaboration takes us.
- **The Vibe:** No pressure, no gatekeeping. Just good people and fast-paced building.

### Format
Sofiia from Live Coding Collective will be guiding us through this evening!

- **7:00 PM – Intro**
- **7:15 PM – Team Up:** We’ll split into small groups (2–3 people).
- **7:20 PM – Build (Round 1):** Heads-down building with your teammates.
- **8:00 PM – Break:** Grab a drink (Beer? Sake? 🍶), swap ideas, and hang out.
- **8:20 PM – Build (Round 2):** Refine your prototypes or try something new.
- **8:50 PM – Demos:** Optional! Show off what you made (even if it's broken).
- **9:10 PM – Social:** Hang out, network, and make friends.

### What to bring

- 💻 Laptop / Notebook (Tablets are not sufficient)
- ⚡️ Good vibes
