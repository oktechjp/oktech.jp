Good Autumn, Friends! üçÅ

While the leaves turned red and we are meeting once more. We also have some news for you! First off: we are opening our group chat. ü§† Jake has been preparing this for a bit and now you can...

**‚Üí Join us on Discord:** [https://owddm.com/discord](https://owddm.com/discord) üí¨

*Back to this event, we have two presentations this week:*

1\. Presentation: Martin is planning to have his next entry on the topic of Logins\. This time he will look into Logins for Businesses\.
***Features of a modern Login System*** üîê based on AWS Cognito. Answering the question of what it does and why. Al while keeping in mind what effort it might take to implement them. ü•∏

2\. Presentation: Gregory will talk about '** Buying/Renting in Japan with a bit of Neumorphism**'.
In this brief presentation, we explore the age old question. Is it better to buy or rent a home (Japan Edition)? Join and help me as we go through a simple Svelte app I made as a fun little project to help folks answer this pervasive yet elusive question. On the way, we also discuss some elements of Neumorphic design, what it's like using it and whether you should use it.

For now we have two presentations this month, so if you want to try out a presentation for the next events please contact us. ‚Üí [Presentation Proposal](https://forms.gle/KifJzLSmcXUPxSFk7)
