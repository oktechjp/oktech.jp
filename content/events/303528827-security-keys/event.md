Hello friends,

in November Martin is going to hold a workshop together with Tillmann where we look at how to use Hardware Security keys.

Now that we have [WebAuthn](https://webauthn.io/) reasonably well supported. Now we can have a [Yubikey](https://www.yubico.com/) or other security devices to be used for 2FA and to iron our security. In this two part session we will first look at the possibilities and difficulties that come up when using security and then try out keys together. It would be awesome if you could bring your own, but we will have a few to try out at the event.

We are happy to be hosted at [C2 Kyoto](https://c2kyoto.com/) once more! To support the venue the C2 is offering drinks. Please do not bring outside food or drinks. Thank you. Drink sales help us to support the event. (Also, please note that only cash is accepted at the moment üôáüèª)
