Let's turn over a fresh green leaf! 🥬 In this year of the horse 🐴 we strap in a for a full year of tech-challenges! neigh!

Getting ready we start with a presentation/discussion by _Karim_ on _"How to balance Spinach"_, the acronym Hou報ren連sou相 ー Report 報告 Inform 連絡 Consult 相談 ー is one of the fundamentals that we will discuss. Find out together what to look out for in a Japanese work context and how to balance your life and comfortably fit in. _(→ [Thread in Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1034792577293094972/1437260103639367742))_

Following a longer series of [supply-chain attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_attack), we are happy for _Greg_ to tackle how to _"Create your own simple dev container"_. Things that we probably all should be doing in 2026, if we are working in any way with code, but have not gotten around to yet.
