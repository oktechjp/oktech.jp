Let's use the cold time to stack up on tools!

This February we bring our notebooks and let Kinbiko show us how Docker can expand our tool belt. Docker has been very important in the tech industry for quite some time now. We will take 2 hours to see if Docker is still useful, learn how we can apply it in our tasks and get better a technology hat has become standard at this point.

*Beginner? Intermediate? Advanced?* Everyone is welcome! While it is going to be difficult to make sure that everyone gets the same amount out of the workshop, our goal is that there is something for every level. We are looking forward for you to join us.
