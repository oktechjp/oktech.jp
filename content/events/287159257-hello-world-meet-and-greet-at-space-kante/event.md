Hello Friends, ðŸ‘‹

A short notice meet & greet in Kyoto this time, to kick off the KWDDM and see where this journey might take us.

As the weather is not stable, we are going to meet at [Space Kante](https://space-kante.com/kyoto/) this time.

There is no event fee but Space Kante costs currently 1000 JPY/day. Please note that you can not pay with Cash (Credit Card/Mobile Payment provider). If you need help paying, send us a message.

The meeting time is open ended. Martin will be there from about 14:00\~19:00, in case you want to talk longer.

Looking forward to see you. ðŸ¤—

PS.: Together with our sister group OWDDM, we are having a survey for members. If you have a few minutes, it would be nice if you could fill out:
