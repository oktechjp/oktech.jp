Hello Friends,

Its August and because Kyoto is a melting pot, we decided to escape it and have a day out of town. We have been talking about it in the [#meet-irl](https://discord.gg/EHFRBVMqnW) channel on our discord but the event publication here is on short notice and we understand that it might be difficult for you to join.

The plan is following:

1. 11:30 - We meet at [Keihan Ishiyamadera station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kTSbsfvEqEswbjcW8).
2. 12:00 - We have lunch at [R's Happy Bake](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HpRM6KQZG7MWrtvUA). (We can take a reservation for people that RSVP)
3. After lunch we go to [Ishiyama Temple](https://www.ishiyamadera.or.jp/) and look at all the temples. *(1100yen for the entrance fee, main hall and side temple, 600yen if you only wish to traverse the temple)*
4. After the temple - we plan to visit an Onsen. We will decide together which to take, but possible options are:

* Old and small [Yoki-yu Sento](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RH4LCXgaFTTjL6fH8) (490 yen) in the area, [9min (230yen)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Wh1NHqewanrN7WeUA) by bus or 30min on foot
* [Biwako-za](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HtZ4cCu841AyQyka6) (60min 650yen) - [380 yen for transport, 40 min](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZikhZKtQgcPUhoYy6)
* [Super Sento Suishun](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MPQ5NxdXZ8Mn7g7s7) ([1050yen](https://suisyun-ticket-shiga.com/items/6685ffa9f325fc0224847411)) - [470 yen for transport, 53min](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4DexrGFX78Thzr5r5)

After that we may or may not head out for dinner or back home.*(depending how we feel)*

Besides a towel and fresh underwear for the bath, please bring tech topics to talk about! If you have a special topic you are interested in, mention it in the comments so we maybe can prepare for it.
