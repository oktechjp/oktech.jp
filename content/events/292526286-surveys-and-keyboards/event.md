Hello Everyone, 👋

After a bit of a break, we want to start again with two presentations! 🚀 Tiro secured the Oinai Coworking space for a Friday evening talk tech and design. 🤩

For our first presentation, [Sacha Greif](https://sachagreif.com/) will be talking about his work on surveys [State of JS](https://stateofjs.com/), [CSS](https://stateofcss.com/en-us/), and the future of his surveys. We will be getting a behind-the-scenes look at his work running developer surveys.

Ben Foden will then show us, how to make excellent 3D printed keyboards and beyond. Using free software, readily available parts, and a 3D printer he uncovers simple ways to get custom made items tailored perfectly to our needs and taste.

Beside our offline events we also have a [Discord channel](https://owddm.com/discord) that we use to organize our group. We are happy for you to join us.
