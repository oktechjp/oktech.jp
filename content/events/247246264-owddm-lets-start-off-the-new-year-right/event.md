Dear all, even as I write these lines I realize it’s been quite a while since our last gathering in Osaka. Therefore, I take the opportunity to invite everyone to the first 2018 Web Designers and Developers Meetup. We are still setting up the list of speakers and as soon as possible will offer you a preview of our lineup for the February event. By the way, if you are interested in presenting this month please let us know and we will accommodate you.

** Update **
This month we are having two sessions brought to you by Adrien Lemaire and Marcel Takagi.

Adrien will help us improve our hard skills with an "Introduction to Kubernetes", an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications - so many buzzwords.

Marcel is going to introduce us to the "Jobs-To-Be-Done" Framework, making us shift our thinking by taking a different perspective on user needs, with a focus on causality and outcomes.
****

Don’t forget to sign up and join us on Saturday, February 24th 2018 at 6PM. We are meeting at Aiming Inc’s Osaka Office. After the meetup we will go to a nearby place where we can have some drinks and socialize some more.

See you soon!
