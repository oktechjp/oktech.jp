We survived this summer!And this months meeting will be all about speed. üöÄ

Long time member *Gregory King* will be looking into *what‚Äôs it like working with WebAssembly on the ‚ÄúFrontend‚Äù?*

Have you ever wondered *what it‚Äôs like writing in WebAssembly (WASM)*? or if we can write WASM like we do React? - Do you love web development, but had enough of JavaScript? In this short talk, we explore what it‚Äôs like building web apps with [Yew](https://yew.rs), a Rust based web framework for writing frontend web apps in WebAssembly.

There is still space/time for another presentation. If you have something you want to talk about, [propose a presentation](https://forms.gle/umcRKdEy9SekLQL68)!

For a hot while, we have been asking attendees to give us feedback using our survey below. Until now only few people responded. If you have some time we would deeply appreciate your voice.
