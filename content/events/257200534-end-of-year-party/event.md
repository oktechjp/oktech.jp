Hi Everyone!

We plan to get together for a year-end party along with the folks from HNKansai just like last year, at the very same place! We will meet on Friday 28th from 8pm at Galleria, a very nice pizzeria with a lot of space for people to talk and drink together ðŸ™‚ It is located just near Osaka Umeda so easily reachable from all major train lines.

We plan to have a fixed menu (2400 JPY for a full course per person) while we are still in touch to finalize the details. We will post more details as the event approaches.

Please Subscribe into HN Kansai meetup, here is the link:

See you soon!
