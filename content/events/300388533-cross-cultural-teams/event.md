Hello Friends, its not quite summer yet. Join us for a chill Saturday evening talking about working with other people.

For this event we have the always great [Chad Kohalyk ](https://chadkohalyk.com/) give us a crash course in cross cultural teams:

Communication is the lifeblood of an organization. As an international in Japan, it is highly likely you are working in Not only a multilingual but a cross-cultural work environment. You may be in a local office with Japanese coworkers, or working remotely with development teams overseas, or managing multi-timezone teams within a giant multinational.

We will get a short overview of Erin Meyerâ€™s excellent book *[The Culture Map: Breaking Through the Invisible Boundaries of Global Business](https://erinmeyer.com/books/the-culture-map/)* which lays out an 8-scale framework for analyzing business culture and developing strategies for an effective team. We will dig into a couple of key factors so that you can go to work the next day with some new perspective and even some tips.

This in an **interactive session**. Come prepared to contribute as we will ask everyone to sit in groups that *maximize diversity* of country and culture. You will get the opportunity to work through each of the scales in small groups. All you need to bring are: your own experiences as a cross-cultural person; an open mind; and a pen/pencil.

*NOTE*: Although we will be discussing research on different cultural contexts, we will handle this topic with sensitivity. The point is **not** putting people in boxes, but to appreciate the different ways people can operate across a spectrum relative to you, and to one another other.
