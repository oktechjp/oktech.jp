Dear designers and developers,

As the new season is arriving we take the opportunity to announce our next meetup in Osaka. You are welcome to join us on March 25th at 6PM, at our usual venue kindly provided by Aiming Inc. This month we have some exciting speakers:

Tiro Swaby (https://www.neopent.com/), a Canadian designer based in Kyoto will talk to us about digital design and prototyping tools such as Sketch or InVision. Continuing with the design topic, Kite Koga (http://kiteretz.com/), prolific Osakan web designer and programmer will give us a talk on UI/ UX: "Let's Think about the Right Answer of Design and UI/UX"

Finally, Ben Murden, CTO at Musicisum (https://www.musicisum.net/about/) will say a few words about his experiment with Nginx on Heroku with Google Pagespeed.

No doubt this month we will have some very useful sessions for both designers and non-designers. Newcomers are welcome here!

After the meetup we will go out for drinks and socializing at a nearby Izakaya. There will be an opportunity to network with like-minded developers and designers.

See you there: March 25th at 6PM, Aiming Inc.!
