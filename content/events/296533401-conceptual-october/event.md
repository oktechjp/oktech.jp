Hello web friends! ðŸ‘‹

finally, we don't sweat at night anymore and in this busy October, we are kindly hosted by [Cybozu](https://cybozu.co.jp) and would like to invite you for a bit more reflective event. We have three presentations this time!

How can we notice planned obsolescence in tools? Is it better to plan obsolescence? How do budgets control the obsolescence in the digital world?
In **"(un)planned obsolescence"** *Martin* would like to invite to explore new perspectives in project planning, feature creep and power. With a focus on the web, he will introduce this further concepts, not limited to the physical world.

In their first time presentation, *Destiny* will be presenting about **"Digital Marketing Strategies"**. Sharing lessons learned and how we can combine it with Web development.

And in a rare third presentation for the month we are happy to have Eduardo Gonzalez will be talking about large language models. In **"Obsoleting OpenAI with local models for agents"** we will be getting insight in new ways to deal with LLM's that might have the power to make a lot of current effort seem like old things rather quickly.

We are also planning our November Meetup which will likely be JavaScript-focused. If you have a topic that you would like to talk about, take the chance and let us know via the [â†’ Discord](https://owddm.com/discord)

We hope you will join us and have a nice October! ðŸ‘‹
