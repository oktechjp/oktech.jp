Summer break - in case you had one - is over and the heat is still on! ☀️😎

This month we have two talks about how tech is going. Sacha will be talking about [State of HTML](https://stateofhtml.com/en-US) and the things he learned about how HTML developers are doing these days.

And in our titular presentation, Martin will be exploring an aspect rarely reflected upon when talking about tech: Emotion, specifically *"fears"*. Over the years, he had many difficult situation and only now learned what they have in common. Looking at how fear impacts the technological progress. He will discuss fears such as *"What if my code is breaks something?"* , *"What if I cant make the deadline?"*, *"What if my family hates me for staying up late?"* and more.
