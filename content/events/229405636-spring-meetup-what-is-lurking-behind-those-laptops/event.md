Hello Osaka (and Kansai) web designers and developers, spring is arriving and we have some exciting speakers for the next Meetup on 19th March. We welcome new-comers, experienced developers and designers.

In this coming Meetup, we will try to open up some of our regular members' laptops and see what is lurking behind them! They will introduce some of their tools that they use and sharing some of their experience in setting up web design and applications.

Please join us at the meeting space at Aiming for an informal and casual exchange. They generously provided a place for us.

Note: After the meetup we usually go out for drinks and socializing to a nearby Izakaya.
