Hello everyone,

Spring is here and we hope you enjoyed the cherry blossoms ðŸŒ¸. Now that we are in Spring we have a meetup for you. ðŸŒ±

This month first-time OWDDM presenter Sammy will be talking about the relationship between users and platforms with **[Nostr](https://nostr.com/)**. Nostr is a new messaging system between users - an SNS. We can be looking forward to an overview of why it exists, how you can use it, and the possibilities of what can be built with it.

The second presentation is going to be as relevant as it is going to be conceptual. Martin noticed that many people have trouble identifying **what a designer does** and is going shine a light on it from the perspective of a developer. This topic may seem obvious but in face of Code and image generation through AI - in a time where No-Code is a hot topic and Apps can be built by single persons we may need to re-think what a "**designer**" does as a profession.

* RSVP to join us âž¡

The presentation idea comes from our Discord group.
