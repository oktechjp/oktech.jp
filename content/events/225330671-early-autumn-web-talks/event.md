The first cool nights have arrived, and typhoons seem to be a distant memory. Kaki-fruits are about to be in season again and we find ourselves in the tempered japanese autumn.

Web developers and designers from Osaka or other corners of Kansai: you are welcome to join us and talk about web in light spirit. Our talks are often very casual about things related to our work such as new CSS features, layout of websites, importance of workflows, difference between database and/or payment systems, new wordpress features, docker setup and oh, so much more.

For the last time we will be at C7 coworking because it has been received well in august's meetup. Lets

After the meetup we usually go out for drinks in a nearby izakaya.

We are having an organisation setup on github . If you feel like helping, having a problem or taking over the task or have something cool that you want to present please let me know! We are looking for volunteers.

Thank you and looking forward to see you!

Ps.: We said last time that we want some designers to have a presentation. Please contact me if you have time to talk about layouts, japanese web design, accessibility etc.

Note: Former rules about recruiting persist.
