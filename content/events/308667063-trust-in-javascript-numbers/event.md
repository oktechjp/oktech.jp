Right after the [jsconf](https://jsconf.jp/2025/en) and wedged around TC39 and TPAC meetings we are having a JavaScript-ey Saturday evening and you are welcome to join us!

We are happy to welcome guest speaker _Christian Ulbrich_ from the [DresdenJS](https://dresdenjs.io/) to join us presenting _"0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3!"_ in which he will go round and round with JavaScript numbers and explain in detail why is JavaScript so odd with them and what can we actually do about it, to get even.

Also joining us is the first presentation by _Yuto Yoshida_ about [AlpineJs](https://alpinejs.dev/). He will share about the essentials of AlpineJs with some practical examples how to use it.
(→ [Thread on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1034792577293094972/1429338549349781634))

Even if you are not into JavaScript, this should be interesting! We are looking forward for you to join us at the date and until then, see you in → [Discord](https://owddm.com/discord)
