Welcome back web developers and designers!

We're hoping to resume our meetup in a safe manner by holding an outdoor gathering (a picnic!) at Tsurumi Ryokuchi Park on Saturday 27th of June, weather permitting.

We intend to keep the format open and have more discussions than one-sided talks, but to kick things off Benjamin Murden will discuss his journey into the JAMStack - a means of building sites that can be deployed to the edge, so they can be served from fast CDNs.

Please bring a mat to sit on and your own food and drinks. Families are welcome.

Meeting point: at the gate of the Tsurumi-ryokuchi Station on the Nagahori Tsurumi-ryokuchi line.

Weather forecast is sunny 28C/83F, 10% chance of rain. Please make sure you have plenty of water, suntan lotion or sunscreen.

There is a convenient store Lawson close to the station. You can get food and drinks there.

If you are late, please check back on this web page for the exact location. We shall update it tomorrow.
