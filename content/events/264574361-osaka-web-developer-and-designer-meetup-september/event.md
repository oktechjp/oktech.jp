After the great event last month, we're back at AmidA (near Honmachi station) again.

Christian Oliff will give an introduction to Google Analytics with an optimized setup and tips & tricks for tracking downloads, links, errors and more.

We have the pleasure of welcoming Front-end developer, Kevin Eulenberg from Germany who'll give a talk on mastering the Gutenberg editor without coding and compiling own Gutenberg Blocks in a comfortable way.

After the talks there will be an opportunity to chat and get to know each other over drinks and food at a nearby izakaya.

The event will start at 18:30. The event is free, but we are accepting donations at the izakaya to help pay the Meetup.com fees.

Address: AmidA Osaka Office, 7 Floor, Shinano-bashi Mitsui Building, 1-11, Utsubohonmachi, Nishi-ku, Osaka
