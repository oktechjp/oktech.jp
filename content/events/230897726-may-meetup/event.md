Dear all developers, designers and enthusiasts, welcome back for our May’s meetup, the first one after the Golden Week.

This month we would like to invite you to join us for discussions on Web Components, Web Security basics, plus a 15 minutes Q&A session for beginners. Don’t worry, this time we will keep the Q&A session on the point, providing answers to beginners on technical aspects of their interest.

Fellow beginners and enthusiasts, feel free to leave us a reply with questions you would like to address at this meetup. Let us know what questions you have for our experienced members.

Although our discussions sometimes may drift into geeky stuff we try to keep it at a level where people unfamiliar with the topics can understand. If you are interested in websites, no matter at which level, we welcome you!

This month we couldn’t get the meeting room at Aiming Inc. thus we will meet at Cybozu (http://cybozu.co.jp/osaka/) in the Hankyu building! Please take the Business Elevator in the Umeda Hankyu Building Office Tower up to the 15th floor to the Sky Lounge and from there the elevator to the 35th floor.

Note: After the meetup we will go out to an Izakaya for drinks and conversation!

If you feel like helping, taking over a task or wish to hold a presentation/ discussion please let us know! We are also looking for help.

Come join us for an informal and casual talk about web development and design! Thank you and looking forward to see you!
