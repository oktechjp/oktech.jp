Join us in August for another great meetup with topics on web design and web programming. For those of you who won't be escaping the summer heat at end of the month, we have the opportunity to meet again on August 26 at 6PM, at Aiming Inc.’s Osaka Studio.

After a short self-introductory session, Daniel (https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielojedaloisel/) (a Spanish developer who recently joined our group) will introduce us to the concept of Extreme Programming. As he defines it, “extreme programming is a software development methodology, a set of practices to achieve its 5 core values. It focuses on lowering the cost of change which is mainly related with the maintenance cost of the software products. Beware! Some of its practices are dangerously addictive, at least for me.”

Matthew Badeau (whom you already well know from previous meetups) will continue the chatbot discussion with a talk about the chatbot he made to collect temperatures from around his office. Last month we saw the UI/UX perspective and this month we are going to see what toolkit to use and how it can be used for internal company projects.

After the meetup, we usually go to a nearby Izakaya for some drinks and some more relaxing chat.

Looking forward to see you on August 26 at 6PM. Beginners are welcome!
