Welcome back, dear Web enthusiasts!

The air is gradually cooling all around us, but our web talks are heating up! As always, we aim to exchange ideas and knowledge on topics related to web design and development. All you need is an interest in the web, regardless of your experience.

Our first talk this month will be on web optimization with Benoît Quenaudon. He'll be showing us how to make the most of the browser developer tools you already have to vastly improve your user experience.

Sacha Greif will be talking about state in Javascript. Local state, global state, state management, stateless... You can't go far in 2016's JavaScript ecosystem without hearing about "state". But what does it all mean? Sacha will help you understand the mysteries of React and Redux, without having to write a single line of code.

Continuing from Ken Ho's talk last month on 3D in Javascript, Rahmat Hidayat will illuminate the world of creative coding as used in web apps for marketing and promotion.

After the meetup we will go out to a nearby Izakaya for drinks and post-meetup socializing. There will be an opportunity to network with like-minded developers, designers and enthusiasts.

We hope to see you on September 24 at 6PM, at our usual venue kindly provided by Aiming Inc.

See you there!
