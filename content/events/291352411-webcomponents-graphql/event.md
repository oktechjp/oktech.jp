Hello Everyone!
It's February o'month. Time is flying!

[Follow Us and Don't Miss Any Meetings!](https://owddm.com/discord)

This month we will have kind of a deja'vu. **James** and **Martin** are both going to re-discover topics that they have been talking about years back but for some reason are still timely.

James is going to present about **[WebComponents](https://www.webcomponents.org/)**, why the are interesting and how they work.

After that Martin is going to revamp his *"**Introduction to GraphQL**"* in which he will look at how GraphQL works in the updated version look into where it is useful and why it exists.

Both presentations this month have come from the [Discord](https://owddm.com/discord) channel. If you have something you would like to talk or hear about: [JOIN US](https://owddm.com/discord)!
