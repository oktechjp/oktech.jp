Its getting colder and we sure want to take the October opportunity to exchange about what we did these hot summer months.

We were able to get a spot in the Knowledge Salon which is worth visiting just for the fun of it. There have been no presentations decided as of now.

If you wish to talk about something just mention it in the comment:

We have 4 spots each 25 mins (shorter is possible too of course).

Afterwards we will can go out for drinks & food too ;).

Restaurant/Bar suggestions welcome.

Cheers!
