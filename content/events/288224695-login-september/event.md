Welcome to September, Friends! ðŸ‘‹

The 67 Diner was a nice location last month and it will host us one last time before it's reopening! ðŸ¤©

Sliding into Autumn Martin will be continuing on his journey into Login systems, this time more on the practical side, looking into Login UI's and how the variants can be seen under different lights. ðŸ¤“

If you wish to have a presentation as well, we still have a slot left! For more information please have a look at our [Presentation Proposal Form](https://forms.gle/cEVvuWAfKn4hhMAk8).

As we are still starting with this meetup group, we *(volunteers)* would love to know more about you âž¡ï¸Ž [Survey for KWDDM members](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfzo6DecghqIfir5O-2eiuQXPf81j97XcOCVEr6eJgUSEGeMw/viewform)
