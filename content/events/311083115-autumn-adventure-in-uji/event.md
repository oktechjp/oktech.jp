Did you know there's a hidden fifth season hiding in plain sight between Japan's suffocating summer heat and its beautiful fall folliage? That's right, it's hiking season!

Let's explore Uji and its mountains while it's still t-shirt weather. We'll walk through the forest all the way to Amagase Dam and then make our way on the other side of the Uji river.

We should be back in town early enough to get a matcha latte, parfait, cake, or basically anything you want as long as it's matcha-flavored â€“ that's kind of Uji's thing.
