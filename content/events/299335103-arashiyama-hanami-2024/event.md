**IN CASE OF RAIN** 🌧️
We will pack up our stuff and move it over to
Restaurant Arashiyama. If a significant number of people arrive we will need to split into smaller groups.

The cherry trees bloom soon!

The weather is getting warmer, and with spring nearly here? The cherry blossoms will be blooming very soon! How about we have a Hanami in Kyoto? From 4 pm to 7 pm, we want to gather all of our interested tech community members for a lovely day out. No more being cramped in an office! It’s time to touch grass with our peers!

Let’s relax under the Sakura trees and make new connections.

But before we do that, **we have a few ground rules:**

* Please bring your mat to sit on
* Please bring your preferred snacks and drinks
* Please clean up after yourself
* Be kind

お花見を楽しみにしていますね！
