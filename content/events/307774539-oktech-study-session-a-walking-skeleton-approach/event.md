Are you a software engineer who enjoys digging into new ideas, practices, and patterns that strengthen your craft? Join us for the next **OKTech Study Session** a gathering for engineers who don’t just code, but want to understand the *why* and *how* behind solid software design.

In this session, we’ll explore the **Walking Skeleton**, a software development technique introduced by Alistair Cockburn. It’s a deceptively simple yet powerful practice that helps you deliver value early, validate architecture choices, and build iteratively without getting lost in over engineering.

We’ll kick off with a short, practical introduction to the concept, followed by break out session to brainstorm about the topic and an open discussion to share perspectives, challenges, and real-world experiences. Whether you're already familiar with the idea or hearing about it for the first time, this session is designed to deepen your understanding through collaboration.

Sessions difficulty: Medium (2+ years in tech)
Meeting Content:

* Introduction (10 minutes)
* Presentation (30 minutes)
* Break out groups (15 minutes)
* Discussion (25 minutes)
* Feedback (10 minutes)

Discussion Style:

* Raise your hand when you’d like to speak
* After finishing your point, indicate who should go next
* Keep each contribution to a maximum of 2 minutes
