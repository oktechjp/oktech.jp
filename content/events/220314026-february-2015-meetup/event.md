Charging right into 2015 we will have our next month web-bashing. We are not sure who will catch next times big

We have not decided yet on "who talks about what" but I found the privacy switch on loomio! (now its open to anyone :p)

Hope to see you all well and healthy in February!

PS.: This site is still very raw. It would be awesome if we had a nice banner/logo. Do you need an outlet for your creativity?
