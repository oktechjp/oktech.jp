Welcome back web developers and designers!

We would like to continuing our outdoor gatherings at Tsurumi Ryokuchi Park on Saturday 21st November, weather and Covid19 social distancing permitting. It is a bit of a short notice but hope that you will be available to participate.

This month we are also teaming up with Sakura Internet's Sakura Club. We will be joined by their Japanese members via Zoom (using our smartphones)! We have been trying to work out a joint event for sometime but due to the Covid19, we weren't able to do that until now.

Ben Murden will kick things off with a quick talk about React Native and it will be joint by Sakura Club via Zoom. After that Fukui-san from Sakura Club will give a quick talk of "Building a community of English and Japanese IT developers" via Zoom. We shall try to interpret the talks in Japanese and English.

You don't need to join the Zoom session but if you are interested, we will let you know the Zoom links on the day.

Please bring a picnic mat to sit on and your own food and drinks. Families are welcome. There is also a Lawson close to the station where you can pick up food and drinks on the way.

Meeting point: at the gate of the Tsurumi-ryokuchi Station on the Nagahori Tsurumi-ryokuchi line.

The forecast is pretty uncertain, so we'll update this page if it looks like we'll have to postpone until the following month. We'll also send out a notification via e-mail if things change, so remember to sign up if you're thinking of coming!

If you are late, please check back on this web page for the exact location. We shall update when we settle on a spot.

* We shall ask the participant for a donation (ï¿¥100~500) to cover our cost.
