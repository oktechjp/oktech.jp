Happy New Year! 🎊 明けましておめでとうございます！

We hope you had a great end of last year! Now that this year started we are kicking it off with two presentations.

Karen, who works in the marketing-side of the web, will be looking in how we evaluate our work and how websites can profit off KPI (Key Performance Indicators).

After that, Martin is taking a break for a bit and will looks into the JavaScript Gamepad API for a bit of geeky joy at the beginning of the year.

By the way, both presentations were proposed in the the #presentation-ideas channel on discord! If you have any questions or comments before the meetup, ask there!
