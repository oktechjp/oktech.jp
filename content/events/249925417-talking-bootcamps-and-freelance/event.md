Summer fun dev-time. What better way to escape the heat than an evening in a beautifully air conditioned room with fine folks talking about web development?

Previously, Oussama told us that he would attend the Le Wagon - Coding Bootcamp in Tokyo. He has returned from his adventure and wants to share his experience with us!

We will also be joined by PHP veteran Jeff Madsen. He has been living in Kansai for many years now and works as freelancer for companies abroad. Within his many publications on PHP, he also wrote a book about freelancing! Jeff will share with us his wealth of experience in his introduction on "How to become a freelancer".

Apologies for the wait, this month we struggled to find a location, but we are finally happy to announce that we can use GVH#5 - The Hive's awesome meeting room in Umeda for the first time.

We are looking forward to seeing you there!

Note: This months presentations have been organized in response to your feedback! If there is something you are looking for in future presentations, please let us know ðŸ‘‡.
