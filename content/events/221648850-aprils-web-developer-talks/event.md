Spring is here, the cherry blossom is about to finish blooming and we shall meet again!

As usually we have open discussions with people of many fields: graphic designing, DBA (Database Admins), HTML, PHP, CSS experts, those that have had experiences setting up business in Japan, crowd-sourcing or outsourcing, successful collaborations and we most certainly welcome you!

Right now the meetings are not yet planned, if you want to hear about something or want to present something just post a new issue on github: https://github.com/owddm/presentations/issues

As a result of last time's meeting I setup a organization repository that contains information on how the meetup is organized at the moment. If you feel like taking over the task please let me know! We are also looking for help.

If you are interested in talking about whatever-that-strike-your-fancy over drinks or food please join. Up until now we have been looking for restaurants ad-hoc but because Saturdays are busy, we ask before-hands if you want to attend to make sure that we can reserve somewhere nice.

Thank you and looking forward to see you!
