Hello Friends, ðŸ‘‹

We are in the last stretch before springs arrives proper! After a refresher on old topics in February, we will focus on the opposite perspective this month.

Two young*er* members of the meetup will go into the basics. **Jake** will be talking about how *"**Programming from a Beginner's Perspective**"* looks like. A perspective much needed for people that try to teach programming or want to make it easier for young ones to enter.

After that, **Miguel** will be giving us an introduction to the *"**Cloud Foundations**"*, discussing the types of cloud service models, as well as sharing some tips on where to get started.

We are looking forward to meet you again this month!

If you are interested in contributing or joining us in broader conversations, please join [https://owddm.com/discord](https://owddm.com/discord).

We are also in the process of preparing next months event! If you have something you want to present please share it in the **[#presentation](https://discord.gg/tb5CZXen)**-proposal channel or [send in a presenter proposal](https://discord.gg/tb5CZXen).

You can also help us shape OWDDM by filling out [our survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfzo6DecghqIfir5O-2eiuQXPf81j97XcOCVEr6eJgUSEGeMw/viewform).
