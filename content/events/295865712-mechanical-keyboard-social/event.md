BRING OUT YOUR KEYBOARDS! ‚å®Ô∏è üôå

[Helpfeel](https://helpfeel.com/en-us/) *(prev. Nota)* will be hosting our **mechanical keyboard** social. We will line up some desks and set up our keyboards. Giving everyone a chance to wander around and try out different setups. Bring some drinks and snacks, and we will bring the hand sanitizer!

If you have ever considered buying a mechanical keyboard, but were intimidated by the options and the cost, this is your chance to try out a bunch by yourself and talk with other people

If you are already in the hobby: bring your keyboards, keycaps, switches, wristrests, and all your keyboard paraphenalia!

*(NOTE: please post some pics of some of your stuff below in order to give people an idea of what kind of keyboards we will have at the meetup!)*

Ben might give us a short lightning talk on keyboard design. If anyone else wants to give a short presentation, please reach out to us in the comments below or [‚Üí on the Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1034792577293094972/1122354952120045628). Non-keyboard topics are okay too.

Do you like your keyboard to CLACK? Or prefer THOCK? Let's talk about how to achieve these sounds, what are the "best" switch-types
Come and hang out with us! *Clickety-clack!*
