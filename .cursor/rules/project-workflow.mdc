# Project Workflow Rules

## Development Server
- A dev server is running in the background - you don't need to run it yourself
- Changes are automatically reflected in the running application
- No need to restart or manage the development server

## Git Operations
- Never make git commands like commits unless explicitly instructed
- Don't run git add, commit, push, or any other git operations proactively
- When asked to commit, follow the user's exact instructions

## Testing Guidelines

### Playwright Tests
- Never use --headed mode for playwright tests
- Always use the default headless option
- This ensures tests run efficiently in the background

### Running Tests
- Use `npm run test` for development testing
- Use `npm run test:build` very sparingly at the end of big changes
- Run tests to verify your changes work correctly

### Type Checking
- Use `npm run typecheck` after editing imports
- This is quick and ensures TypeScript compilation succeeds
- Always fix TypeScript errors before considering work complete

## Development Workflow
1. Make changes to code
2. Run `npm run typecheck` if imports were modified
3. Run `npm run test` to verify functionality
4. Only run `npm run test:build` for major changes
5. Wait for explicit instructions before any git operations

## Best Practices
- Test incrementally during development
- Fix errors as they appear
- Don't accumulate technical debt
- Keep the codebase in a working state
