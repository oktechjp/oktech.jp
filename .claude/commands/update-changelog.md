Update our @CHANGELOG.md with the latest changes. Do not edit old changelog entries, just add new ones.

Follow the existing format of the changelog.

Ensure that you split out each day according to git commit history and diff details.

Ensure you split the day based on the user's timezone.

Do not just go by commit names, actually check the diffs and see what was changed.

The changelog should focus on USER-FACING features and improvements.

Do NOT include technical details like:

- Refactoring
- Code organization changes
- Internal naming changes
- Technical implementation details

DO include:

- New features users can see/use
- UI/UX improvements
- Visual changes
- New functionality
- Performance improvements users will notice

However, if you need to pad things out with technical details, you can do so.
